# Build

The build we will play is **Righteous fire**. It's pretty tanky, the clear is good enough but it's weak at single targets so we will avoid bosh rushing, essences, metamorphs, etc

## Advices in the progress

 * Use this regexp to buy equip before Act.4: ```"b-b-r|b-[br]-b|r-b-b|nne|rint|Flam|Earn"```
 * Use this for shield charge ```"r-r-g|r-g-r|g-r-r"```
 * Ignore long passive quests

## Advices before completing Act.10

**Right after killing Kitava:**

 * Get all passives (use /passives)
 * Calculate budget to craft basic gear and do heist for chaos recipe until get the budget (normally 30 or 35 chaos).
 * Re-spec if required to get the resistance nodes in the passives tree. Prioritize it before damage.

**Then kill Kitava and buy the basic equip to:**

 * Get 3000+HP
 * Cap 150+ fire resistance
 * Cap at 80% resistances

## Early Game Gear

Most of the items can be crafted. Use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3OQzbyyxpI) as reference.

## Body armour

The best way to get a decent 6 links is buying {%include trade.html e="LX22fn" txt="Emperor of Purity" %} cards. 

Then use the harvest to either:
 * Craft chaos until you hit a good tier of any other resistance + life and craft % of phys taken as fire.
 * Craft physical until you get additional physical reduction + life and craft armour (flat or %) then craft **"more likely"** to try to increase the tiers. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ngJNVIjSVXc?si=8CdnTMad0xae6SQJ&t=88)
