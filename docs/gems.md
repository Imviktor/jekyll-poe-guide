# Gems
There are two ways of making 20/20 gems:

 1. Level up until lvl 20 then apply 20 Gemcutter's Prism {%include img.html path="e/e2/Gemcutter%27s_Prism_inventory_icon.png"%}.
 2. Level up until level 20 then vendor it with 1 {%include img.html path="e/e2/Gemcutter%27s_Prism_inventory_icon.png"%} to get a 
 level 1/20 gem. Then level up again until level 20.

Once the gems are 20/20 you can apply the methods described bellow to make profit.

## Level and corrupt

The jackpot is reaching **21/23** (using Alva's Temple). Otherwise you will be aiming for **21/20** or even **21/0**. In order to make profit of the **21/20** 
gems, their value must double the value of the 21/0 version unless you spend your **divines** 
{%include img.html path="5/58/Divine_Orb_inventory_icon.png"%} buying **gemcutter's prisms** 
{%include img.html path="e/e2/Gemcutter%27s_Prism_inventory_icon.png"%}. I would recommend to use the 
gemcutter's only if this method is your main income source.

The mayor profit of selling is **corruption**.  Applying a **vaal orb** 
{%include img.html path="2/2c/Vaal_Orb_inventory_icon.png"%} has several different outcomes weighted equally:

-  Adds or removes a level to the gem with a maximum of level 21
-  Adds or removes up to 10% quality to the gem with a maximum of 23% quality
-  Transforms the gem into its Vaal skill version
-  Nothing happens

This means, you will get a 21 level gem in **1/4 attempts** or **1,25** of gems levelled at the same time. Furthermore, the gem you are trying to build 
must be 4 times more valuable than the 20/20 version to get any profit. That's why I recommend to use this method as a passive income and try not to 
waste much time on investigating.

### Alva's temple

This method aims to get gems **21/23** because of the double corruption. Due to the time it takes and the risk of breaking the gem is not really worth. 
Anyway, this method is mandatory when corrupting **awakened gems** or exceptional support gems (*enhance*, *empower* or *enlighten* exceptional).

## Level and regrading lens
For this purpose we will be using **Prime Regrading Lens** 
{%include img.html path="4/43/Prime_Regrading_Lens_inventory_icon.png"%} and **Secondary Regrading Lens** 
{%include img.html path="a/a4/Secondary_Regrading_Lens_inventory_icon.png"%}. Normally, you spend 20 
{%include img.html path="e/e2/Gemcutter%27s_Prism_inventory_icon.png"%} to level the 20/0 gems. 
Otherwise it would take too long considering this can be a main income source.

 * The **Prime Regrading Lens** {%include img.html path="4/43/Prime_Regrading_Lens_inventory_icon.png"%} works 
for **skill** gems.
 * The **Secondary Regrading Lens** {%include img.html path="a/a4/Secondary_Regrading_Lens_inventory_icon.png"%} 
works for **support** gems.

The best gem to regrade is inspiration support. The distribution of the alternative qualities are the same for *anomalous* and *divergent* therefore 
is the less risky (this gem has no *phantasmal* quality). The most valuable one is the **divergent** quality but the **anomalous** can help to mitigate 
the loss of not hitting the divergent. For this purpose, you must use **secondary regrading lens**.

In the following table, the 20/20 column is the price for the gem you already have. The 20/20 corrupted is the worse scenario and the 21/20 column is the best. 
The 20/23 might be also worth and the 21/23 is if you want to try with Alva's temple (not recommended).

## Awakening level

For this scenario, the best is to check in [**poe.ninja**](https://poe.ninja/economy/ancestor/skill-gems?corrupted=No&gemType=Awakened) the prices of 
the awakened gems at level 1 and level 5. Then you can make the difference and evaluate which gems are worth to level. The more expensive the gem is, 
the more profit you will get from levelling. Normally you can get the 10% of the gem value as profit.

To level up the gems, you have to use the [**Wild Brambleback**](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Ancestor/Zv9nVOEfQ) beast which grants 1 
level to a **non-corrupted** awakened gem.
